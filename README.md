# Exploring Policy Optimization for Multilevel Medical Security and Commercial Health Insurance Based on Financial Principles

This project aims to explore the optimization methods of multi-level medical security and commercial health insurance policies based on financial principles. By integrating big data and medical analysis technology, we hope to optimize resource allocation and improve the rationality of premium distribution while improving the fairness and sustainability of the medical security system.

## Project Background

In the current medical security system and commercial health insurance environment, traditional methods often lack the organic integration of predictive modeling and financial strategies. This leads to inefficient resource allocation, unfair premium distribution, and regulatory compliance issues. To address these challenges, this study proposes a unified computing framework called **Finance MedNet**.

## Research Content

1. **Finance MedNet Model Construction:**
Utilize multimodal data (demographic information, medical history, claims data, etc.) to achieve accurate claims prediction and financial strategy formulation through advanced neural network structures.

2. **Risk-Adaptive Financial Strategy (RAFS):**
Combine adaptive reserve allocation, fair premium adjustment and uncertainty-driven sampling to reduce model bias and improve the robustness of prediction.

3. **Experiment and result analysis:**
The model was verified and compared through experiments. The results showed that the method has significant improvements in claim prediction accuracy, premium fairness and compliance, indicating that the model has practical feasibility and scalability.

## Key innovations

- **Integration of multi-level medical insurance and commercial health insurance**: Consider the design of multi-level medical insurance needs and commercial health insurance mechanisms at the same time.

- **Strategy optimization driven by financial principles**: Introduce risk management, reserve allocation and fairness principles in finance into medical insurance optimization.

- **Integration of big data and intelligent analysis**: Use advanced neural network modeling technology and medical big data for prediction and strategy optimization.
